For a while I have been trying to focus myself into the Front-end area, the truth is that I like to fiddle with modern Javascrip frameworks and I feel very comfortable using this technology. I also have Back-end experience developing REST APIs in C# along with SQL SERVER databases, but, I wouldn't dare say that I am Full-Stack in any technology because first of all, I have spent much of the time in the last years developing code into the front with AngularJS and secondly because I think that to call yourself Full-Stack, you have to be very sure of it and that is why today I am striving to expand my knowledge to a level that allows me to be able to say that I am Full-Stack in some set of technologies in a safely way.",
        "bio_par3": "As you have seen, I have developed this website so that it transmits a retro look & feel using styles, fonts and other things so on as if we were using an old terminal because my passion for technology was started when my parents brought our first computer at home, and it was a machine with an Windows 98 with which I spent many hours carrying out small experiments and this website has been a good excuse to be able to pay a small tribute to that time of my life that marked me so much. Oh, by the way, I think that the movies of the late 80s and early 90s like Terminator 2, War Games, Back to the Future and a long etcetera that I saw as a child, also has something to do with the fact what today I like everything that has a retro-geek feel :)"
