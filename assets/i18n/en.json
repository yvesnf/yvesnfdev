For a while I have been trying to focus myself into the Front-end area, the truth is that I like to fiddle with modern Javascrip frameworks and I feel very comfortable using this technology. I also have Back-end experience developing REST APIs in C# along with SQL SERVER databases. I have spent much of the time in recent years developing code on the front with AngularJS and recently with Angular 8.",

Oh, by the way, I think that the movies of the late 80s and early 90s like Terminator 2, War Games, Back to the Future and a long etcetera that I saw as a child, also has something to do with the fact what today I like everything that has a retro-geek feel :)"
